# Instructions (keep answers concise and explicit)

* Use “-” bullets for lists. Leave fields blank if unknown.
* **Contrast** defines numerator vs. reference (e.g., L vs R), so **positive NES/effects = up in L**.
* If starting with **GSEA-only**, say so; enhancer (ESEA) evidence can be added later.
* Optional fields are for context/hypotheses; treat them as provisional, not requirements.
* **Red_Flag_Contradictions** is optional; leave it blank if unsure—the agent will apply default assay-specific red flags.

## Core Study Context

**Study_ID:**

**System_Model:**

* Example: Human cancer cell line; organoid; patient cohort.

**Perturbation:**

* Example: Small-molecule (name, target); CRISPR KO/knockdown (gene); cytokine; radiation; combination.
* Dosing & timing: [dose(s), duration(s), schedule].

**Contrast (case vs control):**

* Define groups: case = __ ; control = __ ; **positive NES/effects = up in case**.
* Replicates: case n=__ ; control n=__ .

**Assay_Context:**

* RNA-seq for GSEA ranking (specify library type if relevant).

**ESEA_Status:**

* Availability: [none yet | will add later | ready].

**Known_Biology (short bullets):**

* Example: Perturbation is expected to reduce proliferation.
* Example: May induce stress/apoptosis or immune tone depending on context.

**Key_Questions:**

* Example: Do cell-cycle programs decrease under treatment?
* Example: Are inflammatory/IFN/TNF modules engaged or suppressed?

**Cell_Types_or_Programs_of_Interest (optional):**

* Example: Lineage program(s) relevant to model.
* Example: Specific regulatory modules (e.g., FOX-family, GATA-family enhancers).

**Expected_Phenotypes_or_Trends (optional, expectations not mandates):**

* Example: Expect E2F/cell-cycle down; apoptosis/stress up at later timepoints.

**Pathway_Hypotheses (optional):**

* Example: TNF–NF-κB signaling (candidate up); translation/mTOR (candidate down).

**Red_Flag_Contradictions (optional):**

*Guidance: List 3–6 plausible explanations for misleading signals (direction, timing, technical, mapping). For each: why it’s risky, and a quick check to confirm/refute. If left blank, the agent will insert defaults.*

**Quick‑pick checklist (tick what applies):**

* Direction mismatch with expected effect of the perturbation
* Timing inconsistency (signal appears at an unlikely timepoint)
* Technical/library artifact (batch, normalization, rRNA depletion issues)
* Helper label interpreted as identity (should be treated as regulatory module)
* Mapping/overlap artifacts (hub genes, inflated Fisher from small overlaps)
* Composition/confounders (cell mix changes, serum, passage)

**Examples:**

* Mitotic spindle ↑ after cytotoxic treatment → could be batch/outliers; **check** cell‑cycle markers & replicate consistency.
* Inflammatory signals ↑ at a late timepoint → could be timing artifact; **check** earlier timepoints and leading‑edge composition.
* Translation ↓ with rRNA depletion issues → could be library bias; **check** QC metrics & housekeeping gene behavior.
* Helper “fibroblast” interpreted as identity → label bias; **treat as a regulatory module**, not lineage; **check** motif/TF activity alignment.

**Orthogonal_Evidence (optional):**

* Example: Viability/Annexin V; phospho-S6; GR/TF ChIP; imaging markers.

# QUICK EXAMPLES (remake)

### Example 1 — Small‑molecule stressor in a cancer line

**Study_ID:** A549_DrugA_vs_DMSO

**System_Model:** Human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line.

**Perturbation:** DrugA (MAPK pathway inhibitor).

* Dosing & timing: 1 µM, 24 h.

**Contrast (L vs R):**

* Define groups: case = DrugA; control = DMSO; **positive NES = up in case**.
* Replicates: case n=3; control n=3.

**Assay_Context:**

* RNA-seq for GSEA ranking (polyA). Optional: ATAC-seq for validation later.

**ESEA_Status:** will add later.

**Known_Biology (short bullets):**

* MAPK inhibition often lowers proliferation and can raise stress/apoptosis.

**Key_Questions:**

* Do E2F/cell-cycle programs decrease? Are apoptosis/stress modules engaged?

**Cell_Types_or_Programs_of_Interest (optional):**

* AP-1/STAT/FOXO regulatory modules.

**Expected_Phenotypes_or_Trends (optional):**

* E2F/cell-cycle down; UV_RESPONSE_DN up; apoptosis up.

**Pathway_Hypotheses (optional):**

* TNF–NF-κB (candidate up); translation/mTOR (candidate down).

**Red_Flag_Contradictions:**

* Cell-cycle ↑ under drug → could be batch/outliers; **check** replicate PCA & Ki-67 markers.
* Inflammatory ↑ without phenotype → could be off-target; **check** time-course & cytokine assays.

**Orthogonal_Evidence (optional):**

* Annexin V at 24–48 h; cleaved PARP Western.

### Example 2 — CRISPR knockout in immune cells

**Study_ID:** PBMC_CRISPR_KO_vs_WT

**System_Model:** Human PBMCs (mixed immune populations).

**Perturbation:** CRISPR KO of GeneX (immune adaptor).

* Dosing & timing: constant KO; harvest 48 h post-activation.

**Contrast (L vs R):**

* Define groups: case = KO; control = WT; **positive NES = up in case**.
* Replicates: case n=4; control n=4.

**Assay_Context:**

* RNA-seq for GSEA ranking (ribodeplete).

**ESEA_Status:** none (start GSEA-only).

**Known_Biology (short bullets):**

* GeneX supports TCR signaling; loss may dampen cytokine pathways.

**Key_Questions:**

* Are IL2/STAT5, IFN-γ, TNF–NF-κB reduced? Is apoptosis increased?

**Cell_Types_or_Programs_of_Interest (optional):**

* T-cell activation modules; NF-κB/STAT TF families.

**Expected_Phenotypes_or_Trends (optional):**

* Cytokine signaling down; apoptosis/stress modestly up.

**Pathway_Hypotheses (optional):**

* TCR signaling (down); interferon responses (down).

**Red_Flag_Contradictions:**

* IFN/TNF pathways ↑ after KO → could be compensatory cytokines or cell-mix shift; **check** composition markers & cytokine release.
* Global translation ↓ without viability change → could be normalization artifact; **check** rRNA metrics & housekeeping stability.

**Orthogonal_Evidence (optional):**

* Cytokine bead array; flow markers of activation.

### Example 3 — Cytokine treatment timepoint

**Known_Biology (short bullets):**

* IFNα induces JAK–STAT and ISGs; may curb translation downstream.

**Key_Questions:**

* Are interferon alpha/gamma responses up? Is mTOR/translation down?

**Cell_Types_or_Programs_of_Interest (optional):**

* STAT/IRF enhancer modules.

**Expected_Phenotypes_or_Trends (optional):**

* Strong interferon signatures; modest E2F changes.

**Pathway_Hypotheses (optional):**

* Interferon signaling (up); mTOR/translation (down).

**Red_Flag_Contradictions:**

* IFN response absent → could be dosing/timepoint issue; **check** phospho-STAT1 and ISG qPCR.
* mTOR/translation ↑ at 6 h → atypical; **check** phospho-S6 and later timepoints.

**Orthogonal_Evidence (optional):**

* pSTAT1 Western; ISG qPCR; polysome profiling.
