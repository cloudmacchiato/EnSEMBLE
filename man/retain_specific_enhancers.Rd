\usage{
retain_specific_enhancers(enhancer_sets, maxMulti = 0.05, minSize = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{enhancer_sets}{Named list of enhancer sets where each element is a
character vector of enhancer IDs.}

\item{maxMulti}{Maximum fraction of sets an enhancer can belong to before it
is discarded. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{minSize}{Minimum number of enhancers required to keep a set after
filtering. Default is \code{10}.}
}
\value{
Named list containing only the retained enhancer sets.
}
\description{
Filters enhancer sets to keep loci that appear in relatively few sets and
removes sets that become too small after filtering.
