\title{Disambiguate Set Enrichment Analysis (SEA) Results}
\usage{
disambiguation.SEA(
  GSEA.select,
  weight,
  compare.list,
  qValue.cut = 0.5,
  minSize = 10,
  nPermSimple = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GSEA.select}{A data frame containing the initial GSEA (or ESEA) selection results. It must
include a column named \code{Compare.List} with pathway names.}

\item{weight}{A numeric vector of weights (e.g., computed from DE.weights) where
names correspond to enhancer identifiers.}

\item{compare.list}{A named list of enhancer sets. The names should correspond to set names,
and each element should be a vector of enhancer identifiers.}

\item{qValue.cut}{Numeric. The q-value cutoff threshold (default is 0.5) above which pathways will be filtered out.}

\item{minSize}{Integer. The minimum size of enhancer sets to consider in \code{ESEA_fast} (default is 10).}

\item{nPermSimple}{Integer. Number of permutations for \code{ESEA_fast} (default is 10000).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{pathway.filtered}{A data frame of filtered pathways after disambiguation.}
  \item{pathway.todel}{A character vector of pathway names that were removed.}
  \item{disambiguate.matrix}{A matrix of disambiguation q-values used in the filtering process.}
}
}
\description{
Filters and disambiguates set enrichment analysis results by comparing overlapping
pathways in the initial GSEA selection. The function removes elements from each pathway that
are shared with other pathways, computes disambiguation q-values using \code{ESEA_fast}, and
then filters out pathways based on a q-value cutoff.
}
\details{
The function compares each pair of pathways from \code{GSEA.select} by removing elements in one pathway
that appear in another. It then uses the custom function \code{ESEA_fast} to compute q-values on these modified
enhancer sets. A disambiguation matrix is constructed from the q-values, and pathways with q-values above
\code{qValue.cut} are flagged. Finally, the function filters out pathways according to these flags.
}
\note{
This function depends on the custom function \code{ESEA_fast} being available in the package.
