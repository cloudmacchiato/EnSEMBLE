\title{Plot SEA Results with ggplot2 and ggrepel}
\usage{
plot_SEA_results(ESEA_results, compare.list, counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ESEA_results}{A data frame or data.table containing SEA results. Must include at least the columns:
\code{Compare.List}, \code{NES}, and \code{pValue}.}

\item{compare.list}{A named list of enhancer sets where each element is a vector of gene identifiers.
The names in this list must correspond to the values in \code{ESEA_results$Compare.List}.}

\item{counts}{A numeric matrix of counts, where rows represent genes and columns represent samples.
Row names should correspond to gene identifiers.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object is generated that visualizes the SEA results. Points are sized by the pathway
  detection rate and their transparency is determined by the negative log10 of the p-value. The top 3
  and bottom 3 pathways (by NES) are labeled.
}
\description{
Generates a scatter plot of SEA (Set Enrichment Analysis) results using ggplot2 and ggrepel.
}
\details{
The function first computes the gene detection rate as the fraction of samples with counts greater than 1.
Then, for each pathway in \code{ESEA_results}, it computes the average detection rate over the genes that are present
both in the pathway (from \code{compare.list}) and in the \code{counts} matrix. The results are ordered by NES,
and a scatter plot is created where the x-axis represents the ordered pathways and the y-axis represents the NES.
Selected pathways (top 3 and bottom 3) are labeled using \code{geom_text_repel} for clarity.
