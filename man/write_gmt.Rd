\title{Write Gene Set GMT File}
\usage{
write_gmt(geneset.list, file.name, default_desc = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{geneset.list}{A named list where each element is a vector of gene symbols (or identifiers). The names
of the list represent the gene set names.}

\item{file.name}{A character string specifying the path and filename of the output GMT file.}

\item{default_desc}{A character string used as the description column when none is supplied
in the gene set name. Default is \code{"."}.}
}
\value{
No return value; the function writes the GMT file to disk.
}
\description{
Writes a gene set list to a GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file. If the specified file already exists,
it will be deleted before writing the new file.
}
\details{
The function writes a header line followed by each gene set in GMT format. For each gene set, it splits the gene set name
by the last colon (if present) and writes the gene set name, a description (if any), and the list of genes.
When no description is provided, the `default_desc` placeholder is used.
