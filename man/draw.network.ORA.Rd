\title{Draw Network from Enhancer Set Enrichment Analysis Results}
\usage{
draw.network.ORA(
  ESEA.results,
  threshold = 0.1,
  node.size = 20,
  line.thickness = 10,
  font.size = 1,
  wrap.string.width = 10,
  FirstCharacterUpperCase = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ESEA.results}{A data frame containing ESEA results. It must include the columns:
\code{NES} (normalized enrichment score), \code{GHid} (enhancer identifiers), \code{pvalue},
\code{Compare.List}, and \code{leadingEdge}. Additional columns (e.g., for significance) may be present.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Cosine similarity threshold for including edges in the network (default is 0.1).}

\item{node.size}{Numeric. Base multiplier for node size, which is further scaled by the absolute NES value (default is 20).}

\item{line.thickness}{Numeric. Factor to scale edge thickness (default is 10).}

\item{font.size}{Numeric. Font size for node labels in the network plot (default is 10).}

\item{wrap.string.width}{Numeric. Maximum width (in characters) for wrapping node labels (default is 10).}

\item{FirstCharacterUpperCase}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, converts node labels to title case (default is \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
The network plot generated by \code{igraph::plot}.
}
\description{
Constructs and plots a network based on enhancer set enrichment analysis (ESEA) results.
}
\details{
The function first classifies each enhancer set as "Up" or "Down" based on its NES value.
It then constructs a binary membership matrix from the \code{leadingEdge} lists,
calculates cosine similarity between enhancer sets, and converts the similarity matrix to a links data frame using
\code{otuSummary::matrixConvert}. Links with similarity values below the specified threshold are filtered out.

A nodes data frame is created using the NES values to scale node sizes and the classification to set colors.
Finally, the network is constructed and plotted using functions from the igraph package.
