\title{Compute Differential Expression Weights}
\usage{
DE.weights(DE_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{DE_result}{A data frame output from ENSEMBLE.DEE containing differential expression results. It must include the columns:
\code{stat} (test statistic), \code{pvalue} (p-values), and \code{GHid} (enhancer identifiers).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of weights, where each weight is computed as:
\deqn{w = sign(stat) \times -\log_{10}(pvalue)}
}
\description{
Calculates weights from differential expression results by taking the sign of the test statistic
multiplied by the negative log10 of the p-value, and assigns them to the corresponding enhancer identifiers.
}
\details{
This function computes weights for downstream analyses, such as enhancer set enrichment analysis.
