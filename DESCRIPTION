Description: Provides enhancer-centric preprocessing, differential enhancer
    expression (DEE), set enrichment (ESEA/GSEA), and visualization utilities
    for perturbation studies. Includes scripts for generating enhancer and
    gene matrices from FASTQ files plus a lightweight LLM agent interface for
    summarising enhancer-helper evidence alongside pathway results. 
    eORA for trait-associated SNPs enrichment analysis.
